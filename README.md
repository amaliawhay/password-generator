# password-generator

This project is a random password generator. It will ask for the user to specify some password characteristics such as password length and if the user wants to include upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Depending on what the user's preferences are for each of these questions, a random password will be generated and it will display in the text box. Here the password can be easily copied and used for any chosen purpose.
